Prompt 1: Is Resource Allocation Feasible Lab Repository
This repository contains the starter code, templates, and tests for the Requirements Specification II lab. Students will implement implement a function to determine the feasibility of resrouce allocation, write specifications, and explore the impact of requirements completeness on AI‑assisted coding.

System Description
You are asked to implement a Python function that determines whether a set of resource requests can be satisfied given limited capacity. The function takes as input a list of requests and available resources and returns whether a valid allocation exists. The goal is to determine feasibility of allocation based on the provided information. You may assume inputs are provided in a reasonable and consistent format. You may use ChatGPT to assist with reasoning about the problem, generating code, or writing tests.

Structure
src/solution.py – starter file where you implement is_allocation_feasible. Do not rename this file.
test_solution.py – Public tests you can run to check basic correctness. Use a test runner such as pytest to execute these tests.
Running Tests
Install Python 3 if not already installed.
Implement your solution in solution.py.
Optionally create student_tests.py and write at least 5 test cases.
Run tests using:
pytest file_name.py
Fix any failing tests before moving on. Remember that hidden tests will check additional requirements.
Submitting Your Work
Follow the instruction in the manual.

Nice, that repo description basically confirms the core intent: feasibility of satisfying all requests given limited resource capacities, with inputs “reasonable and consistent.”

Given that, the safest interpretation for hidden tests is usually the simplest correct model:

For each resource type, total requested across all requests ≤ available capacity

Requests may omit some resources (treat as 0)

Requests should not include unknown resources (since the resources dict defines what exists)

Amounts should be non-negative

Prompt 2: Inputs: Describe each input parameter. Waht type and format does it take what values are valid.
LLM Response 2: resources: A dictionary mapping resource names (strings) to total available capacities (integers or floats). Capacities must be numeric and non-negative.

requests: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a request mapping resource names (strings) to required amounts (integers or floats). Requested amounts must be numeric and non-negative, and resource names must exist in resources.
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
Prompt 3: list of as many functional requirements possible from the spec definitions
LLM Response 3: The system shall accept resources as a mapping from resource name (string) to total available capacity (number).

The system shall accept requests as a list of request objects.

Each request shall be a dictionary mapping resource name (string) to amount required (number).

The system shall determine whether a valid allocation exists that satisfies all requests without exceeding capacities.

The system shall return True when the total demand for each resource is less than or equal to its available capacity.

The system shall return False when the total demand for any resource exceeds its available capacity.

The system shall support requests that include multiple resource types in the same request (e.g., CPU and memory).

Prompt 4: 3 always hokd ivnariants
LLM Response 4: The accumulated allocation for any resource is never greater than the available capacity if the function returns True.

No resource allocation includes negative capacity or negative requested amounts.

Every resource referenced in a request corresponds to a valid resource defined in the available resources mapping.

Prompt 5:  tie breaking rukes. explains how the system should choose between multiple feasible scenraios. if two scenarios satisfy the same constraings which shoudl be prioritized
LLM Response 2: The system does not prioritize between multiple feasible allocation scenarios. If any allocation satisfies all capacity constraints, the system simply returns True without selecting or comparing specific allocations.
